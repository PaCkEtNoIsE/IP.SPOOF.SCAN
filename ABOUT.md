```
This script main intent is to be a performance art piece!
To draw attention to a dangerous trend of labeling any IP address scanning the internet as "malicious" and "dangerous". 
Port scans are not illegal. 
Port scans are not dangerous. 
Port scans can also be faked.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS TO WORK PROPERLY:
|- Python3
   |- which python3 -> /usr/bin/python3
|- Scapy Python3 libraries
   |- python3-scapy
|- IPHM-Enabled Server
   |- Server without BCP38 turned on
|- Most important
   |- Having a server that is able to spoof IPv4 addresses is certainly the most important part of this performance piece.
